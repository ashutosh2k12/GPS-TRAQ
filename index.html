        <h3>Welcome to GPS-Traq Project.</h3>

<p>This is the project from four engineering guys who are self-esteemed in making something awesome that will make this world a better place to live into</p>

<pre><code>Languages used:
Python
PHP
Javascript(with ajax)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to know what this project really is, and why would it matter to you, read on.....</p>

<h3>About this project</h3>

<p>We've started this project as a small university project, but since then, user feedback and suggestions keep it upgrading a lot and soon,it no longer remained a small college project. So we thought to give some boost and make it a large project enough. So it turned out to what it is now</p>
<p>Now let me first tell you what this project is. This is not a location tracking project. We are not tracking you. That's something you don't want to unless a security breach for your travel is there.
This is a project of location sharing and socializing user experience for their travels. This obviously needs information of location but tracking is something exclusive. This is not monitoring you with intention of peeking on you. It rather ask you for location based services if you want to share, or keep it to yourself. </p>

<h3>Why should I go for it?</h3>

<p>Consider yourself in a situation where you have are traveling a particular route and you don't know that you just passed by a restaurant which was your dad's favorite. Or maybe, you are traveling and you don't know that there is your best buddy who is also seeing something which you might be planning tonight. There are such situations for users where they miss out something special in their lives while traveling. We want to fill that <u>"something"</u>.</p>
<p>Not only this much. You may be low on your fuel and you don't know where the fuel pump is, nearby and how would you reach there? Wanna take cash out but don't know where the ATM is? Hire a cab, with a finger click. Now that is the world we want to make. Isn't it awesome?</p>
<p>People want security. Here is the deal. We already have the info of your vehicle, on internet, which you can view anytime, anywhere. You have details of every second of your vehicle. This makes a little easy for you to guess where you missed it last time. Even in severe conditions like accidents, we will provide the information, without any delay, to wherever you want us to. Isn't that secured? Moreover, nobody can drive your vehicle until and unless he has the password for the vehicle.  Now this is a deal.

<p>Socially, this is a kind of distributed system which we want to build on a public cloud(if possible). All users' information will be there, on the could and we will build a social pattern to keep you updated with your friends and known ones. You can then have social experiences of your own and your friends too like where they went to dinner last Sunday? Where you had met your best friend, where is that pancakes shop which you like the most?
This is social!!!
